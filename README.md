# Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features

## Overview

This project implements a **Fashion Recommendation System** that uses deep learning to analyze fashion images and recommend similar clothing items. The system leverages the VGG16 convolutional neural network to extract visual features from fashion images and uses cosine similarity to find similar items.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

### Core Functionality

- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract high-level visual features from fashion images
- **Similarity Matching**: Implements cosine similarity to find visually similar fashion items
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provides personalized fashion recommendations based on visual similarity
- **Fashion Image Analysis**: Processes various types of clothing items (dresses, suits, tops, etc.)

### Use Cases

- **E-commerce**: Help customers find similar clothing items
- **Personal Styling**: Suggest outfit combinations based on existing pieces
- **Fashion Discovery**: Explore similar styles and trends
- **Inventory Management**: Group similar items for better organization

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
Input Images → VGG16 Feature Extraction → Feature Normalization → Similarity Calculation → Recommendations
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **Image Preprocessing**

- Resizes images to 224x224 pixels (VGG16 input size)
- Applies VGG16 preprocessing (mean subtraction, normalization)
- Handles various image formats (JPG, PNG, JPEG)

#### 2. **Feature Extraction**

- Uses VGG16 model without top classification layers
- Extracts 7x7x512 dimensional feature maps
- Flattens features to 1D vectors
- Normalizes features using L2 normalization

#### 3. **Similarity Calculation**

- Implements cosine similarity between feature vectors
- Filters out the input image from recommendations
- Ranks similar items by similarity score

#### 4. **Recommendation System**

- Displays input image alongside similar recommendations
- Shows multiple similar fashion items
- Provides visual comparison of styles

## 📊 Dataset Information

### Image Collection

- **Source**: Fashion images from various categories
- **Format**: JPG, JPEG, PNG files
- **Content**: Women's fashion items (dresses, suits, tops, etc.)
- **Size**: Variable image dimensions (automatically resized)

### Image Categories

- Anarkali suits

## 🧠 Technical Details

### Model Specifications

- **Base Model**: VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Input Size**: 224x224 pixels
- **Feature Dimensions**: 7x7x512 → 25,088 features
- **Normalization**: L2 normalization for cosine similarity

### Similarity Metrics

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between feature vectors
- **Range**: 0 (dissimilar) to 1 (identical)
- **Threshold**: Configurable similarity threshold for recommendations

## 🎨 Sample Results

The system can identify similar fashion items such as:

- **Dress Styles**: Similar cuts, patterns, and colors
- **Traditional Wear**: Matching Anarkali suits and ethnic wear
- **Formal Attire**: Comparable business and formal clothing
- **Party Wear**: Similar evening and party dresses

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Multi-modal Recommendations**: Combine visual and text features
- **Style Classification**: Automatic categorization of clothing styles
- **Personalization**: User preference learning
- **Real-time Processing**: Web interface for instant recommendations

### Technical Improvements
